    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      INFINITYPAX was founded on the conviction that it is essential to preserve fundamental principles of privacy while using data and enabling military personnel to migrate their expertise to the private sector.
    </p>
    <p>
      From our work in various military campaigns to our current work spanning the public, private, and non-profit sectors, we deliver software and personnel that incorporate the principles of privacy by design.
